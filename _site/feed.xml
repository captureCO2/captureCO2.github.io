        <title>Why Direct Air Capture</title>
        <description>Over 25% of carbon dioxide emissions come from the transportation sector where fossil fuel dependence is very strong.  While electrification of the car and truck fleet will help mitigate the amount of CO2 being released by this sector, electrification will take some time to implement and in some cases isnâ€™t feasible (aka air travel).  Thus it is not unreasonable to think that there will continue to be a large distributed release of CO2 into the atmosphere from transportation which due to its distributed nature cannot be addressed like point sources with traditional CCS solutions.  The only solution to mitigate the CO2 emissions from these distributed sources is direct air capture of CO2.</description>

        <title>Overview of Moisture Swing Sorption Process</title>
        <description>The dry membrane material can adsorb high quantities of CO2 even when the CO2 is present in the low concentrations present in the atmosphere.  The membrane is able to reach 96% of its completely saturated state with concentrations of CO2 down to 100 ppm.  The membrane then can released the CO2 it absorbed when it is wetted.  This CO2 is released at a concentration in excess of 50,000 ppm, a two order of magnitude increase in concentration.  The membrane can then be dried again and reused to absorb CO2.</description>

        <title>Overview of Proposed Direct Air Capture Process</title>
        <description>First, we use moisture swing sorption to capture CO2 from air and produce a stream containing 5% at 1 bar. Next, use a conventional amine absorption system to further separate CO2 from the rest of the gas stream and produce a CO2 rich stream containing 90% CO2. Then, Compress CO2 to 150 bar. This allows CO2 to be supercritical, meaning it is much more dense and can be stored in a relatively small location. Finally, Pump supercritical CO2 into underground porous rock formations for sequestration!</description>

        <title>Cost Estimate for Direct Air Capture with Moisture Swing Sorbent</title>
        <description>These prices reflect the total cost of capturing 1 tonne of carbon dioxide using the three respective capture schemes.  The cost estimate includes both capital and operating costs of carbon capture and sequestration.  Clearly, it is much cheaper to capture carbon dioxide at its source.  However, to overcome the hurdles in climate change mitigation, it is necessary to go above and beyond mitigating the amount of carbon dioxide released by fossil fuel power plants.  Our proposed direct air capture scheme is much more economical, and could be economically viable with a far smaller carbon tax than conventional technologies would allow.  This is due to the novel use of the drying capabilities of atmospheric air as opposed to the energy intensive temperature and pressure swings that conventional technologies utilize. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sources: &lt;br&gt;[1] Radosz, M.

        <title>Viable locations For Moisture Sensitive Process</title>
        <description>This material regenerates, or releases CO2 when exposed to moisture. If the material is exposed to moisture before the sorption process, it won&#39;t be able to absorb as much CO2.This technology requires dewpoint of -2C to 8C to operate, which places limits on where technology is viable year-round.Fortunately, there are still plenty of viable locations in US and around the world. Locations with suitable year round dew point are shown above in white, pink, and purple.</description>

        <title>Water Concerns</title>
        <description>HOWEVER, this technology requires reasonable amount of water which can be provided by desalination for little cost. Desalination requires only small amount of energy compared to energy density of carbon sources (15-30kWh/tonCO2). This amounts to only 10-20% of our capture energy cost, or 0.2% to 0.4% of carbon energy collected by power plant.</description>
