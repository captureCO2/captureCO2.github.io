        <title>Overview of Moisture Swing Sorption Process</title>
        <description>The dry membrane material can adsorb high quantities of CO2 even when the CO2 is present in the low concentrations present in the atmosphere.  The membrane is able to reach 96% of its completely saturated state with concentrations of CO2 down to 100 ppm.  The membrane then can released the CO2 it absorbed when it is wetted.  This CO2 is released at a concentration in excess of 50,000 ppm, a two order of magnitude increase in concentration.  The membrane can then be dried again and reused to absorb CO2.</description>

        <title>Overview of Proposed Direct Air Capture Process</title>
        <description>First, we use moisture swing sorption to capture CO2 from air and produce a stream containing 5% at 1 bar. Next, use a conventional amine absorption system to further separate CO2 from the rest of the gas stream and produce a CO2 rich stream containing 90% CO2. Then, Compress CO2 to 150 bar. This allows CO2 to be supercritical, meaning it is much more dense and can be stored in a relatively small location. Finally, Pump supercritical CO2 into underground porous rock formations for sequestration!</description>

        <title>Viable locations For Moisture Sensitive Process</title>
        <description>This material regenerates, or releases CO2 when exposed to moisture. If the material is exposed to moisture before the sorption process, it won&#39;t be able to absorb as much CO2.This technology requires dewpoint of -2C to 8C to operate, which places limits on where technology is viable year-round.Fortunately, there are still plenty of viable locations in US and around the world. Locations with suitable year round dew point are shown above in white, pink, and purple.</description>
