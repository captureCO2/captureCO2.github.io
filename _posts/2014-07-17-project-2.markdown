description: Over 25% of carbon dioxide emissions come from the transportation sector where fossil fuel dependence is very strong.  While electrification of the car and truck fleet will help mitigate the amount of CO2 being released by this sector, electrification will take some time to implement and in some cases isnâ€™t feasible (aka air travel).  Thus it is not unreasonable to think that there will continue to be a large distributed release of CO2 into the atmosphere from transportation which due to its distributed nature cannot be addressed like point sources with traditional CCS solutions.  The only solution to mitigate the CO2 emissions from these distributed sources is direct air capture of CO2.
