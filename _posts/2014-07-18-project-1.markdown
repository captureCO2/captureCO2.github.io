description: The dry membrane material can adsorb high quantities of CO2 even when the CO2 is present in the low concentrations present in the atmosphere.  The membrane is able to reach 96% of its completely saturated state with concentrations of CO2 down to 100 ppm.  The membrane then can released the CO2 it absorbed when it is wetted.  This CO2 is released at a concentration in excess of 50,000 ppm, a two order of magnitude increase in concentration.  The membrane can then be dried again and reused to absorb CO2.
