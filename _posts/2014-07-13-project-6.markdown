title: Cost Estimate for Direct Air Capture with Moisture Swing Sorbent
alt: image-alt
project-date: April 2015
category: Direct Air Capture of CO2
description: 'These prices reflect the total cost of capturing 1 tonne of carbon dioxide using the three respective capture schemes.  The cost estimate includes both capital and operating costs of carbon capture and sequestration.  Clearly, it is much cheaper to capture carbon dioxide at its source.  However, to overcome the hurdles in climate change mitigation, it is necessary to go above and beyond mitigating the amount of carbon dioxide released by fossil fuel power plants.  Our proposed direct air capture scheme is much more economical, and could be economically viable with a far smaller carbon tax than conventional technologies would allow.  This is due to the novel use of the drying capabilities of atmospheric air as opposed to the energy intensive temperature and pressure swings that conventional technologies utilize. <br> <br> Sources: <br>[1] Radosz, M.
