description: First, we use moisture swing sorption to capture CO2 from air and produce a stream containing 5% at 1 bar. Next, use a conventional amine absorption system to further separate CO2 from the rest of the gas stream and produce a CO2 rich stream containing 90% CO2. Then, Compress CO2 to 150 bar. This allows CO2 to be supercritical, meaning it is much more dense and can be stored in a relatively small location. Finally, Pump supercritical CO2 into underground porous rock formations for sequestration!
