description: This material regenerates, or releases CO2 when exposed to moisture. If the material is exposed to moisture before the sorption process, it won't be able to absorb as much CO2.This technology requires dewpoint of -2C to 8C to operate, which places limits on where technology is viable year-round.Fortunately, there are still plenty of viable locations in US and around the world. Locations with suitable year round dew point are shown above in white, pink, and purple.
